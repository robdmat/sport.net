  <p>Behind most of our favorite music videos is a bartender. This bartender might be dancing, shirtless, bad at bartending and/or mixing a cocktail while falling out of a skyscraper. These are our three favorites.</p>
<p>Thanks to an obscure bylaw drafted by Congress in 1885, music video directors work under a strict mandate: just about every music video ever made must feature a bartender. Their appearances are often very brief, but so commonplace that the Music Video Bartender ought to be regarding as an institution.</p>
<p>Jon Bois, Spencer Hall, and Ryan Nanni each have a favorite music video bartender. One is very bad at his job, one is implausibly good and one is a nexus of shirtless sexual energy.</p>
<p>Think we forgot one? Write it down on a napkin and throw it away or something, because we frankly do not really care.</p>
<h3>Chris Penn in Jay-Z's 'Can I Get A ...'<br><i>by Jon Bois</i>
</h3>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUN9giYJhew?rel=0" height="360" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>In 2011, on the day Penn would have turned 46, someone posted in the talk page of his Wikipedia entry, not to point out style inconsistencies or request a citation, but simply to&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Chris_Penn#Happy_Birthday_Chris_10-10" target="_blank">wish him a happy birthday</a>. We loved Chris Penn, a character actor who often played the loud, craven, dim-witted criminal. In <i>Beethoven's 2nd</i> he was outsmarted by a family of St. Bernards. In <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> he precipitated the least ceremonious end to a Mexican standoff I've ever seen: he squealed, "LARRY STOP POINT'N 'AT FUCKIN GUN AT MY DEEYYAAAAD," everybody shot and everybody died.</p>
<p>Every time I saw him, he was as Chris Penn as he could have been. The sentence immediately preceding the "Death" section in&nbsp;<a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Penn" target="_blank">his Wikipedia entry</a> reads:</p>
<blockquote>Penn appears in Jay-Z's "Can I Get A..." music video as a bartender who mixes drinks and dances.</blockquote>
<p>He was afforded roughly 12 seconds of screen time in this video, which everyone my age has seen dozens of times. Either he was told to make "mix drinks and dance," or he told himself. In any case, he whips himself into grand flourishes and makes the God-fearing shit out of a drink.</p>
<p><figure class="e-image">
    <img alt="penngif" src="https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/10j6ARjepHMRF8vUQRd9aihNW4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3543304/penngif.0.gif">


</figure>
</p>
<p>He's holding on to that cocktail shaker for dear life, desperate for a rodeo clown to come save him. When you ask a man to "mix drinks and dance," director, you must understand who you are asking. Chris Penn does not know how to mail it in or phone it in. He does not trust remote correspondence. He has tiptoed the drink to your doorstep, and bless his goofus-maloofus heart, he has spilled nearly all of it.</p>
<p><iframe height="307" width="600" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" src="//coub.com/embed/5m08j?muted=false&autostart=false&originalSize=false&hideTopBar=false&startWithHD=false"></iframe></p>
<p>Penn, pouring well vodka into the shaker from great height and for absolutely no reason. He is either a rotted-through log in the wake of a motorboat, or dancing. He sneaks a grin at the edges of his mouth, agape in wonder. His eyes are dinner plates, and you have seen this look before. You saw it last time you were at the McDonald's and the three-year-old at the counter was given a nickel to drop into the water and try to catch. That nickel went to the United Way, and Chris Penn is making a god-dang mess of everything.</p>
<p>A bar run by this Chris Penn, after a week's time, would be most efficiently cleaned with a blow torch. Bartenders, even those at the seediest dive bars, wipe their work spaces obsessively, which is no accident. Things like vermouth and Fernet-Branca and Angostura bitters, if spilled, will cling to a surface and reek for a month. Spill them on the floor one time too many and you'll be standing on a Pop-Tart with its top picked off.</p>
<p>This is the sort of bartending that is only permitted in a fictional bar, and even then, only for 12 seconds. In my sophomore year of high school, I would habitually flip on MTV after staggering out of bed. It was too early in the morning to find happiness in anything, but Chris Penn's unjustified, unexplained goofing would make me chuckle, and the cuts were so brief that I felt like I might have been the only one noticing, and the only one laughing.</p>
<p>I wasn't, because I tell friends about it now, and they almost always know exactly who and what I am talking about. He paid us all that visit. He will be happy to make you a drink. His recipe for everything is one part shit all over the floor, because he is terrible at bartending.</p>

<h3>Tony Pike in WHAM!'s 'Club Tropicana'<br><i>by Spencer Hall</i>
</h3>
<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WYX0sjP6Za8" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>I really didn't expect this to become a voyage of discovery, but it did. This is Wham!'s "Club Tropicana," a light bit of satire about British vacation packages for young people seeking fun, sun and alcohol poisoning abroad. It only went to No. 4 in the UK, and appeared nowhere on the U.S. charts after its release in 1983.</p>
<p>That's a speedo George Michael is wearing, and what appears to be a half-consumed Cosmo he's pouring directly into the pool. If you were to draw up what George Michael was doing at any given moment in 1983, you could not do better than this as a guess.</p>
<p>The bartender appears first at :40 or so. He is a lean, wiry man with a mustache, no shirt, a come-and-get-me-cancer tan, a straw cowboy hat on his head and a bandanna tied around his neck.</p>
<p>His real name is Anthony Pike, and he has done or said all of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joined the Merchant Marine.</li>
<li>Was actually shipwrecked in the 20th century -- on multiple occasions.</li>
<p><figure class="e-image">

<li><span>Was close friends with Freddie Mercury, and hosted Mercury's 41st birthday party at the hotel he owned, the Pikes Hotel in Ibiza where the "Club Tropicana" video was shot. </span></li>
<li>Met Mercury with a botched introduction followed up by the lines "Let's try that again: I'm Freddie, and I hope we can be friends," followed by Pike saying "I'm Tony, and I think we already ARE friends, Freddie." </li>
<li><span>Organized said party where a giant cake in the shape of Barcelona's Sagrada Familia collapsed on delivery, 232 glasses were broken, Freddie Mercury's name was spelled out in fireworks and guests flown in almost died when all but one of the engines on the plane failed before landing. </span></li>

</p>
<li>The guest list for that party included  "Julio Iglesias, Grace Jones, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Kylie Minogue, Nigel Benn, Anthony Quinn, Bon Jovi, Boy George, Five Star, Tony Curtis, Robert Plant, Naomi Campbell and Spandau Ballet."</li>
<li>Once got out of legal trouble when Julio Iglesias intervened on his behalf with local law enforcement. Note: there were sections of Spain at one point in history where Julio Iglesias was the law, evidently.</li>
<li><span>Says&nbsp;<a href="http://dannykayibiza.blogspot.com/2012/11/ibiza-legends-tony-pike-part-1.html" target="_blank">he seduced women thanks to staying power granted him by a heart operation in his late-30s</a>. </span></li>

</figure>
</p>
<li><span>Drank heavily for most of his life, even in the opinion of many British people and Australians so that's actually serious heavy drinking.</span></li>
<li>Met Grace Jones at an orgy in New York, and auditioned for her as a lover in Ibiza by following these instructions: "I want you to pick the ugliest girl in the club and bring her back with us to the hotel. There I want you to have sex with her in front of me."</li>
<li>He passed the test and became her road manager.</li>
<li>Had a son murdered in Miami by an insane Italian TV producer in a real estate dispute.</li>
<li>Is still alive at the age of 80 and healthy, somehow, and lives in the same hotel in Ibiza today. </li>
</ul>
<p>Tony Pike is clearly the best music video bartender because he is the only music video bartender who was, in real life, actually the bartender for the video. (And still is.)</p>

<h3>Jim in Pastor Troy's, "Are We Cuttin'"<br><i>by Ryan Nanni</i>
</h3>
<p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nIiFCNBNA2s?rel=0" height="360" width="640"></iframe></p>
<p>Having never been to bartending school, I cannot say if it prepares you to BASE jump with your bar setup and several unpacked bottles of alcohol. My suspicion is that it doesn't. Ttherwise, a lot of people would have a story about that time a bartender-in-training floated by their office window, and we'd probably have far fewer ground floor bars.</p>
<p><figure class="e-image">
    <img alt="troy1" src="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vz48tGiJFGwQxJlCvYb9WISXiw8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3570202/troy1.0.gif">


</figure>
</p>
<p>So, consider how difficult it must have been for Pastor Troy to find the right bartender for this job. Most candidates probably balked at the idea of having to transport all their supplies up to the roof of a skyscraper. Others may have had justifiable safety concerns about serving people who were about to jump off of said skyscraper. Even if all the attendees had signed a waiver, think of the PR nightmare that results from a "BARTENDER SERVES LEMON DROPS TO YOUR DEATH" headline.</p>
<p><figure class="e-image">
    <img alt="troy2" src="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pqFci-528kbj6Meid2-VrPiqN4Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3570228/troy2.0.gif">


</figure>
</p>
<p>And the candidates who were okay with those requests still should have drawn the line at jumping off themselves, especially without a free hand to deploy the chute or a static line to do the job. It's a lot to ask of someone in the service industry, especially when you could just pay one person to serve drinks on the roof and another to do so at the landing site. Saying no to this job opportunity, despite the handsome sum Pastor Troy was likely promising, would be completely reasonable.</p>
<p>Jim -- I've decided this man's name is Jim -- said yes. Why? I don't believe it was confidence, though Jim would have needed at least 100 regular skydiving jumps before anyone would even offer to train him in BASE jumping. Nor do I believe it was the money. You don't get the look of unbridled joy on Jim's face when you're just trying to get paid.</p>
<p><figure class="e-image">
    <img alt="troy3" src="https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNNWGx_nEYjxd-tv71hfrn3xunM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3570236/troy3.0.gif">


</figure>
</p>
<p>I think Jim did this because he decided this death would be a fine way to go out. That's not to say he planned or hoped for this to be his final day on this Earth, but he accepted that possibility. Jim looked at this setup, considered the chances of catastrophe, and said yes. Yes, that's a fitting final page to the story of my life.</p>
<p>It's hard not to envy that ability to approach life not as a balancing of risks and rewards but as a series of narrative opportunities. In Jim's mind, the outcome of the jump was almost irrelevant. He taught me that surviving and living aren't the same thing.</p>

<p>This must be emphasized from the outset: The Bill Belichick Offseason Simulator is a tool, and not a toy. It does not exist to amuse you. It is meant to train prospective football coaches in the art and science of managing the travails of the offseason.</p>
<p>Any fun you may have, or amusement you may find, while piloting this simulator is purely accidental, and should be reported as a software bug.</p>
<p>This "video game," if you would like to call it that, is not about fun and games. It is about getting dressed, resetting the clock on your car radio, shopping at the hardware store, and accomplishing offseason tasks. In other words, it is the exact sort of game Bill Belichick might himself make.</p>
<p>This game is possible to beat, but you may find it frustrating and difficult at times. That is because you are not Bill Belichick.</p>
<p>Best of luck piloting the Bill Belichick Offseason Simulator. Due to its immersive realism and state-of-the-art graphics, the Simulator may take a few moments to load.</p>

  <p>The NBA Y2K series is is returning for one very special episode. If you'd like to see a version of yourself in the game, please write a poem about an NBA player who has disappointed you.</p>
<p>It has been nearly a year since the last NBA Y2K, a series in which we used the video game <i>NBA 2K14</i> to simulate horrific basketball dealings that should never leave the realm of the imaginary. Here is how we last left it:</p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGc8_p61lsY?rel=0" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The full post, in which we strangled the talent out of the NBA,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2014/6/3/5772796/nba-y2k-series-finale-the-death-of-basketball">is here</a>.</p>
<p>I have an idea I both love and hate, so I've decided to bring this back for one (1) episode. This time around, we're not going to destroy the NBA, exactly, but I will need volunteers -- probably around 80 in total. If you're selected, a player (who will probably look absolutely nothing like you) with your name will be a part of the simulation, and may appear in videos and GIFs and whatnot.</p>
<p>Volunteers will be selected on a "which entries I like the most" basis. If you'd like to contribute to this nonsense, please fill out this form:</p>

  <p>Let's dig into the numbers and find out whether West Virginia lost to Kentucky. Well the headline already says they did so whatever.</p>
<p>So, basically what happened is, this is what happened, okay, is West Virginia got straight-up whooped. And actually, I'm a Louisville fan so I wasn't even rooting for Kentucky, really. But to be honest with you, basically they just whomped the shit out of West Virginia. I don't really have any editorial oversight. Anyways, check this out.</p>
<p>I looked up every time a team got its ass whooped in the NCAA Tournament in the Sweet 16 round or later. I decided not to include the first round because I wanted to filter out the little-ass schools like Alcorn State or Hampton or Indiana or whatever. This is what I found out.</p>
<p><figure class="e-image">
    <img alt="differential" src="https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tWTftig-WYEqA4qu3jq2QR3sh-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3548060/differential.0.png">


</figure>
</p>
<p>I didn't go to school to learn how to do charts or anything like that. Basically I just played around with stuff and figured it out myself because I'm pretty smart. I'm also 5'11, which means I'm taller than most people. Anyways I'm a professional writer for my job. So anyways, West Virginia was basically the worst No. 5 seed in the history of the world last night.</p>
<p><figure class="e-image">
    <img alt="5seeds" src="https://cdn3.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f-yrIt1cxLzBk7deZJrcejqPbLw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3548218/5seeds.0.png">


</figure>
</p>
<p>I think a big part of that probably was that Kentucky is real, real good. Like, I don't know if you saw this, but a few days before the game one of the West Virginia players was saying they were definitely going to beat Kentucky. Obviously they didn't because they basically couldn't do anything and just ran around like a bunch of kids while they kept getting dunked on and Kentucky beat them 78 to 39.</p>
<p>Anyways, my point with that last chart is that, look at that. No. 5 seeds have played tons and tons of games in the tournament, but none of them got whooped as bad as West Virginia.</p>
<p>Hold on because I wanted to show y'all one last chart.</p>
<p><figure class="e-image">
    <img alt="lapped" src="https://cdn2.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UDly2wIOZZEBIPXbvTRJS0h5aRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn0.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/3548330/lapped.0.png">


</figure>
</p>
<p>78 is exactly twice as many as 39. Think about it, it's true: you can fit 39 into 78 two times. I would say it's a special skill to lose that bad, but when you think about it it's not because you just have to go out there and be bad as fuck.</p>
<p>Possible reasons West Virginia lost:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>The state of West Virginia is smaller than Kentucky geographically and in terms of population</span></li>
<li><span>There are not any good biscuits available in West Virginia</span></li>
<li><span>West Virginia fans cannot bench press very much</span></li>
<li><span>West Virginia's main product is coal, which is just crappy rocks you can't do anything with</span></li>
<li><span>Everyone in Kentucky is good-looking and smart and it's hard to compete with that</span></li>
<li><span>I actually live in New York now which is bigger than West Virginia</span></li>
<li><span>But even when I was living in Kentucky I was living in a place that was still bigger</span></li>
<li><span>West Virginia didn't try hard</span></li>
</ul>

  <p>Try to play it and see whether you will be able to win [at the game]!</p>
<p>At approximately 11:22 a.m. ET, Dan Rubenstein asked me whether I could program a video game about Kentucky basketball, so I did that. The game entered its beta phase at 11:27 and was green lit for release 11:28.</p>
<p>I hope that you enjoy it. I tried to make it the most realistic college basketball game of the year, which should be easy, because I don't think there are any other college basketball video games this year.</p>
<p>This is a very brief game. I have a longer and much more difficult game,&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/zBW2vmy1FkQ">the Bill Belichick Offseason Simulator</a>, coming next week.</p>
<p>The only rules are: 1. Try your best; and 2. No cussing.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <p>It's the beer bracket challenge.</p>
<p>It seems like there are the same number of years each and every year -- but there are more beers than ever! Jon Bois and Spencer Hall are big-time fans of beer, and feel that all of them are pretty good. Here, they've drawn up a bracket featuring 32 of their favorite brews. You better watch out because it's the beer bracket! It's gonna get ya!</p>

  <p>There are millions of Internet things. Most of them are great! 64 of them are bad.</p>

<p><i>This is by far the toughest region of the tournament.</i></p>

<p><b>SB Nation presents:</b> <i>The bracket of awful Internet things, Midwest Region</i></p>
<p><b>(1) SOMEONE IM'ING YOU ON FACEBOOK.</b> As most recently passed along by&nbsp;<a href="http://www.progressiveboink.com/2015/3/9/8176725/scientific-podcast-goes-boink-episode-125-instagram-mma">Scientific Podcast Goes Boink</a>: "Twitter is for loving people you've never met, and Facebook is for hating people you've always known." Facebook is largely an awful place, made more awful by the perpetual threat (before you disable instant messages) of your high school friend making your laptop ding and asking you to come see his prog-rock band with two drummers, no singer, and a rapper in a VOTE FOR PEDRO shirt.</p>
<p>It's made still more awful by the fact that the "read receipts" feature is on by default, so if you've read their IM and haven't answered, they know it. This is the top overall seed, because read receipts are the worst thing about the Internet. The right to ignore people must be preserved. Anyway, if you get one of these IMs, usher everyone out of the building in which you live, burn it to the ground, and live in the forest until you don't hear airplanes anymore.</p>
<p><b>(16) LOCAL TV STATION WEBSITES.</b> These are especially wretched experiences if you're a freelance writer struggling to pay rent, because the half-done sentences and "they're/their/there" errors twist the knife ever deeper. Some TV station websites are perfectly fine. Some will ask you to take three surveys and watch a commercial from your local dentist and then dump you in an article full of Loren Ipsum.</p>
<p><b>(8) AD PLAYS, ACTUAL VIDEO DOESN'T.</b> Out of principle, I don't use ad blockers. This is one reason I will never blame anyone for using them.</p>
<p><b>(9) ATHEISTS WHO LOVE TO ARGUE.</b> Here's a fun one: tell them there's a gap in the fossil record and then immediately mute them. This will banish them to their own specialized Hell, thereby disproving their argument.</p>
<p><b>(5) KICKSTARTERS FOR WEDDINGS.</b> I swear upon every shred of journalistic integrity I have that I have seen people do this.</p>
<p><b>(12) TINDER PHOTO IS A GUY IN OAKLEYS WITH A FISH HE CAUGHT.</b> Lady friends tell me that easily a third of Tinder photos are of men, especially middle-aged men, showing off fish they caught. They presumably are gunning for the "rugged outdoorsman" aesthetic, but they're rocking M-frame Oakleys, which takes in more of an "I buy my pants at Home Depot" direction.</p>
<p><b>(4) FACEBOOK RE-ARRANGING YOUR FEED.</b> If email or books or anything else used algorithms to bork around with the order of your consumption, we wouldn't stand for it. We put up with it on Facebook because Facebook does not matter.</p>
<p><b>(13) ANY TIME AOL DOES ANYTHING.</b> don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox don't buy vox</p>
<p><b>(6) GOOGLE KILLING GOOGLE READER.</b> Google Reader was my favorite social media network of all time. It was essentially the best possible version of what Facebook could have been. Then Google trash-canned it in an apparent effort to herd us all to Google+. And look, you're reading this on Google+ right now! You're even wearing a Google+ T-shirt, and you flew a Google+ to work this morning!</p>
<p><b>(11) PERSON ON EVERY GOTOMEETING CALL WHO IS BANGING A POT AND SHRIEKING.</b> One person's holding a crying baby. Another has a dog who won't shut up. The presenter is standing in the bathroom, towel over his face, speaking 35 feet away from a speakerphone made in 1996. Conference-calling is like swimming, in that human beings clearly aren't gonna get any better at it, no matter how much time we're given.</p>
<p><b>(3) LINKEDIN REQUEST FROM YOUR HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER.</b> no</p>
<p><b>(14) JON BOIS' TWITTER FEED.</b> 1. Jon works on ambitious project that takes him a month, meaning he'll give you, what, four pieces of content in that time? 2. Jon repeats the same eight or nine gags over and over. 3. Jon tweets like someone who's trapped in a room that won't unlock until he loses every one of his followers. It's insufferable.</p>
<p><b>(7) ALL INTERNET DISCOURSE ABOUT BACON. </b>"I am on Team Bacon! I have no palate and I want to belong. Bacon pizza."</p>
<p><b>(10) MARCH MADNESS BRACKET REPURPOSING TROPES.</b> Oh, so you're too precious to just <i>list</i> some things, God forbid. Yeah, leave that for BuzzFeed. You're not like <i>them.</i></p>
<p><b>(2) ITUNES.</b> I thought I was the only one who messed up a sync and ended up wiping an entire music library that I had spent years building, but multiple friends have told me that they did the exact same thing. iTunes is like having your hand held by a robot who wants to walk into the ocean and die.</p>
<p><b>(15) 23-YEAR-OLD BACHELOR INSTAGRAMMING HIS FRIED EGGS.</b> "Made eggs. Giggity giggity! #ForemanGrill #FamilyGuyQuotes"</p>
<h3>West Region</h3>
<p><i>This is by far the toughest region of the tournament.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.sbnation.com/videos/iframe?id=67282" frameborder="0" seamless="true" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" name="67282-chorus-video-iframe"></iframe></p>
<p><b>SB Nation presents:</b> <i>The bracket of awful Internet things, West Region</i></p>
<p><b>(1) POP-UP ADS ON ILLEGAL SPORTS FEEDS.</b> They're manageable if you can fullscreen it, but otherwise, the game you're watching has to be Game 7 of the Super Bowl in order to possibly be worth it.</p>
<p><b>(16) PERSON WHO TYPES "WOW" IN FRONT OF RETWEET</b>. Wow. Just wow.</p>
<p><b>(8) ROUGHLY 85 PERCENT OF INTERNET MEN.</b> You're being yourselves and I wish you would stop.</p>
<p><b>(9) EVERYTHING LONGER THAN 4,000 WORDS.</b> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com/2014/8/18/5998715/the-tim-tebow-cfl-chronicles">As someone who wrote a 43,000-word article last year</a>, I am one of the worst offenders of all. I don't think we're interesting enough to be talking this much.</p>
<p><b>(5) VAPING.</b> Yeah, I mean, vaping seems pretty silly and all, with the dumb custom-built vape-rigs and whatever. But ...</p>
<p><b>(12) PEOPLE WHO HATE VAPING.</b> ... they're not trying to bother you, they're just some folks going off by themselves and dorking out over something they enjoy. They're over there having fun and you're over here clawing your damn eyeballs out in bitter anguish. Everything is fun and pretty good except for you.</p>
<p><b>(4). ANYONE WHO CHARGES MONEY FOR A "HOW TO BLOG" CLASS.</b> Welcome to Jon's Blogging School!<br>1. Work very, very hard and be prepared to not make money for a while<br>2. Look for stuff nobody is doing, and do that; don't be afraid to aim high and fall short<br>3. Learn how to Photoshop and make video and do other stuff like that, there's lots of stuff for that on YouTube<br>4. Promote your stuff like you're proud of it, and if you're not proud of it, don't get too down about it, because failure is okay and probably necessary<br>5. Be nice</p>
<p>Thank you for attending Jon's Blogging School!</p>
<p><b>(13) EXPERT VILLAGE VIDEOS THAT ARE SPLIT INTO 14 PARTS.</b> This actually would be a 1-seed if it still stood today as the colossal trash fire it once was. If y'all missed out on 2008-era Expert Village ... man, it's the stuff that should be taught in school.</p>
<p>For example, there might be a how-to video on how to make pancakes. This could be accomplished with a three-minute video, but Expert Village dragged the affair out into a 12-minute epic, split it up into 45-second videos, uploaded them all to YouTube, and dumped 30-second ads in front of each one. They never made playlists or linked to the rest of the videos, either, so watching them in order was nearly impossible. They're probably still out there somewhere. It's digital ruin porn.</p>
<p><b>(6) SOMEHOW ENDING UP ON ANSWERS.COM.</b><br>"Jesse Owens was born on September 12th, 1913."<br>[three rollover ads consume screen]<br>"You won't believe how many gold medals he"<br>[click to next slide]<br>"won! Jesse Owens won over one million gold"<br>[nine video ads start auto-playing; your laptop's processor melts and spills out of the USB ports]<br>"trophies."</p>
<p><b>(11) CRAIGSLIST DATING.</b> Go use literally any other dating service. Go find romance literally anywhere else. Go meet someone on a Wikipedia talk page.</p>
<p><b>(3) PEOPLE WHO THREATEN TO UNFOLLOW CELEBRITIES.</b> "Grandpa, how did you win this medal?" The old man's eyes welled with tears. "I followed Kanye West and found him annoying."</p>
<p><b>(14) YELP REVIEWER WHO QUOTES THE "NO TIPPING" SCENE FROM RESERVOIR DOGS.</b> The rarest of Pokemon is the person who misattributes this quote to Tyler Durden.</p>
<p><b>(7) OFFICIAL LIVE TV STREAMS THAT PLAY THE SAME FOUR ADS OVER AND OVER.</b> Over the last year, I have seen the Aaron Rodgers "pump you up" State Farm ad more than I have seen my family.</p>
<p><b>(10) PODCAST MUSIC IS PODCASTER'S BAND RECORDED FROM PHONE.</b> It is a ska band.</p>
<p><b>(2) MANUAL RETWEETERS.</b> I probably like you, but I definitely like you if you don't know what this means.</p>
<p><b>(15) BLOGGERS GOING ON CAMERA.</b> When I went on camera to announce this bracket, I had to keep my cardigan on because there was a giant toothpaste stain on my shirt. We are irredeemable.</p>
<h3>South region</h3>
<p><i>This is by far the toughest region of the tournament.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.sbnation.com/videos/iframe?id=67286" frameborder="0" seamless="true" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" name="67286-chorus-video-iframe"></iframe></p>
<p><b>SB Nation presents:</b> <i>The bracket of awful Internet things, South Region</i></p>
<p><b>(1) BRANDS.</b> Every holiday eventually loses its intended spirit. Christmas has its commercialism, Easter has its Easter bunny, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day has dozens of brands desperately crawling over one another to repurpose the Civil Rights Movement to sell stuff. They take turns throwing themselves upon the pyre every single year because they are stupid.</p>
<p><b>(16) ANYONE WHO STARTS ANYTHING WITH, "SORRY, FOLKS."</b> We really don't need any more scolding on the Internet. Except for this bracket. We need this bracket, and then no more scolding after that.</p>
<p><b>(8) PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT BUZZFEED.</b> I wish they would find a more prominent font/shade with which to credit folks, sure. By and large, though, they're making stuff that people enjoy, and unlike many sites of their kind, they don't carpet-bomb their pages with ads that make their pages unnavigable. Please note that you'll rarely, if ever hear a non-creating Internet user whine about BuzzFeed. If you're complaining about them, you're probably someone who creates Internet stuff yourself. You should be more like them, because people enjoy them a lot!</p>
<p><b>(9) MAYOR OF YOUR CITY CITES BUZZFEED.</b> This is admittedly unfortunate, though. 14 Reasons Why Knoxville Is The Best City In The World!</p>
<p><b>(5) GCHATTERS WHO HIT ENTER AFTER EVERY THIRD WORD. </b>You step away from your computer. From the other room, you hear it: DINK. DINK. DINK DINK DINK. DINK. DINK DINK. DINK. Maybe all your friends just saw the President tweet at you and ask you if you want to eat pizza and play Mario Kart! Or maybe Brandon from work is thinking about watching Chopped.</p>
<p><b>(12) PEOPLE WHO COMPLAIN ABOUT BLEACHER REPORT. </b>it's a good site that i occasionally enjoy</p>
<p><b>(4) RESTAURANT WEBSITES.</b> The lone exception is the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.jonssandwichshop.com/" target="_blank">website for my sandwich shop</a>, of which I am very proud. We are closed.</p>
<p><b>(13) FUTURISTS.</b> Spencer wanted me to put this one in. I don't remember why. Maybe they will understand why in the future.</p>
<p><b>(6) WRITERS WHO TRY TO BE MADDOX. </b>This isn't the problem it used to be, I don't think, so it's only a 6-seed. In the earlier days of the Internet,&nbsp;<a href="http://maddox.xmission.com/" target="_blank">Maddox</a> was one of the only hugely visible Internet Writers. In a proto-Internet full of boring writing and useless crud, Maddox was doing his own thing, and doing it really well. He might not be your bag, and is only sometimes mine. In any case, thousands of Internet Dudes decided to try to be him without really understanding what made him good, and the results were metric tons of the most furious, obscene, offensive, and dull writing there's ever been.</p>
<p><b>(11) CROSSFIT MESSAGE BOARDS</b>. Lemme expand this definition just slightly, because I feel like sharing this:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p>There's a bodybuilding dot com thread where two guys argue about how many days are in a week (via <a href="https://twitter.com/katiebakes">@katiebakes</a> ) <a href="http://t.co/qeiZSlXdyZ">http://t.co/qeiZSlXdyZ</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p>
<script src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</p>
<p><b>(3) COLLEGE FOOTBALL FANS WHO TWEET AT HIGH SCHOOL RECRUITS.</b> no</p>
<p><b>(14) FOLLOW-UP EMAILS FROM PR PEOPLE.</b> This is kind of a self-indulgent entry, which is why it's a 14-seed, but my phone buzzes 10 times a day on account of emails from PR people asking me to promote God-knows-what. Half of them are "I just wanted to follow-up" emails that drag the entrails of the original email behind them like a cloak. I once had a PR person email me, send <i>four</i> follow-up emails, and call me "unprofessional" for ignoring them.</p>
<p><b>(7) SOMEONE ASKING "DID YOU GET MY EMAIL" IN REAL LIFE.</b> "No. I do not own a computer."</p>
<p><b>(10) ROLLOVER ADS THAT WON'T GO AWAY AND TELL YOU YOUR OPINION MATTERS.</b> No it doesn't, as evidenced by the fact that I am trying to watch a video shot from someone's phone of the scene in Home Improvement when a kid tells Tim Taylor that "Tool Time" is more like "Fool Time." My opinion could not matter less.</p>
<p><b>(2) OBAMA'S TWITTER MENTIONS.</b> bad</p>
<p><b>(15) NEW PARENTS ON FACEBOOK.</b> Actually, I'm gonna call an audible and shift this to, "people who complain about new parents on Facebook." That is very entry-level "joyless Internet lump" material. I am the monster I hate.</p>
<h3>East region</h3>
<p><i>This is by far the toughest region of the tournament.</i></p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.sbnation.com/videos/iframe?id=67284" frameborder="0" seamless="true" marginwidth="0" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" name="67284-chorus-video-iframe"></iframe></p>
<p><b>SB Nation presents:</b> <i>The bracket of awful Internet things, East Region</i></p>
<p><b>(1)&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHkABO0VwCg">R*DSK*NSFACTS.COM</a>.</b> That site is part of Dan Snyder's effort to prop up his racism and culture-marginalizing for long enough to sell a few more sweatshirts. I didn't link to the site. Instead, that link goes to what is probably my favorite video on YouTube. It's from a 1994 high school football game. If you haven't seen it, then ohhhh man, you will not regret the five minutes you give it.</p>
<p><b>(16) YOUTUBE LEGAL DISCLAIMERS UNDER UPLOADS OF "THRILLER" THAT SAY "I DID NOT MAKE THIS SONG."</b> I actually love these. They're here because I wanted to bring them up.</p>
<p><b>(8) ANYTHING ABOUT STAR WARS.</b> It's Star Wars night at the ballpark! Dress up like your favorite Star War! Every Star Wars movie is bad.</p>
<p><b>(9) SPOTIFY AD INTERRUPTS AQUEMINI.</b> The $10 it takes to achieve an ad-free Spotify experience are the best $10 I spent every month.</p>
<p><b>(5) DR. HORRIBLE'S SING-ALONG BLOG.</b> I feel like maybe we should grant amnesty for those among us who recommended Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog to the rest of us. Some of us are lousy at math, some of us can't run fast, and some of us have terrible taste. Who among us, and all that.</p>
<p><b>(12) GOOGLE MAPS TELLS YOU TO TAKE THE C TRAIN.</b> If you're trying to get home in New York and you're supposed to take the C, just take literally any other train. Get off at any stop with a name you like, knock on someone's door, and ask if you can live with them.</p>
<p><b>(4) GCHAT BREAKUPS.</b> don't</p>
<p><b>(13) WEB-FUNDED DOCUMENTARIES WITH SOUNDTRACKS THAT ARE JUST WHISTLING.</b> Either whistling, or acoustic-guitar strumming with some twentysomething doof singing "hey-oh! <i>oh-oh-oh!</i>" over it. I recently gave a few bucks to a Kickstarter for a documentary that looked really intriguing, only to find it was formed with the aesthetic touch of a bank commercial.</p>
<p><b>(6) YANKEES WRITING THINKPIECES ABOUT THE SOUTH.</b> "The South is a land of many contrasts. I was in Atlanta's airport one time. Louisville is next to Memphis."</p>
<p><b>(11) HATE-FOLLOWING.</b> It ain't good for you.</p>
<p><b>(3) BASEBALL TWITTER DURING SPRING TRAINING.</b> It's mostly just fans getting in dumb fights and beat reporters sharing grainy, long-distance photos taken through a chain-link fence of David Freese like he's the dang Sasquatch.</p>
<p><b>(14) HOCKEY TWITTER DURING THE NBA FINALS.</b> Insecurity issues abound. It's fine for a sport to be the third- or fourth-best sport! That means it's still a pretty good sport!</p>
<p><b>(7) COORS LIGHT REVIEWS ON BEERADVOCATE.</b> Years ago I made a foray into beer-snobbery and found that it was deeply unrewarding. A growler of Old Man Inquisitor Excoriationist Old Sea Shipwater Man XLVIIIIIIII Ale Stoutale Nitro Interlocutor Behemoth Alestout is great, sure, but so is a can of crummy light beer on a hot day. Every beer is pretty good.</p>
<p><b>(10) COMMENTER ON EVERY DUNK VIDEO WHO SAYS "THAT WAS A TRAVEL."</b> We in this field of work refer to them as "<a href="http://www.sbnation.com/nba/2015/2/27/8116285/everything-is-a-travel-highlight-truthers-are-coming-after-your" target="_blank">dunk truthers</a>."</p>
<p><b>(2) WOMEN BEING ASKED THINGS AND THEN BEING CORRECTED WHEN THEY ANSWER.</b> don't do this</p>
<p><b>(15) SPORTSWRITERS TWEETING FROM AIRPORTS.</b> I've said this before, but we as sportswriters really need to keep on the low with our grievances. Just quietly do our work and not get noticed. When the inefficiencies of our society are rid of, our jobs will first on the chopping block. Who needs a bunch of jerkholes getting between them and the sports? Nobody, really. We need to very quietly ride this deal out until the wrong person notices and does away with this entire useless industry. I mean, do <i>you</i> know how to work a drill press? I don't!</p>
