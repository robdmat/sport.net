  <p>For the first time in 22 years, the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays">Blue Jays</a> roll into the final series of the regular season knowing that they'll still be playing baseball next week. The <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/tampa-bay-rays">Tampa Bay Rays</a> on the other hand are stuck in a three-way tie for third in the division and will hope to put some wins together to lock up a respectable position...or they'll try to tank this weekend to jump two draft slots over their division rivals. It was only a few days ago that <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31593/josh-donaldson">Josh Donaldson</a> walked off against the Rays in Toronto on a warm Sunday afternoon, a win that capped a weekend sweep in the final regular season home series of the year for the Blue Jays.</p>
<p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/810/mark-buehrle">Mark Buehrle</a> will be looking to go 8.2 innings tonight to reach the 200 IP milestone, something that seems very unlikely at this point. Opposing him on the mound will be <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/485/erasmo-ramirez">Erasmo Ramirez</a>, who has been a nice surprise for the Rays this year in the rotation. The right-hander started the year splitting time between starting and relieving, with some awful appearances to show for it. On April 15, Ramirez started in Toronto and allowed eight earned runs in just 3.1 innings pitched. Once he was finally stretched out and given a starting spot for good on May 14, the Nicaraguan began to dominate and has put up a good amount of outings with no runs allowed as well as a 2.99 ERA since that date. The only downside to Rodriguez is that he has struggled to go deep into games all year and has only eclipsed 100 pitches in two outings this season.</p>
<p>The 5'11" right-hander throws a fastball and slider against same-handed batters, while LHH see the fastball and changeup most of the time. He doesn't blow anyone away, although his off-speed pitches are solid and he's currently sitting at a K-rate of 19.2% on the season. In a Rays rotation that features a lot of question marks beyond <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/107909/jake-odorizzi">Jake Odorizzi</a> and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/68495/chris-archer">Chris Archer</a>, the team will certainly be happy to keep the cost-controlled Ramirez around for as long as he continues to perform like he did this season.</p>
<p>You can see how he racks up the strikeouts with his changeup and slider in this video:</p>

  <p>After showing some, but definitely not all, of <a href="http://www.bluebirdbanter.com/2015/10/1/9431071/2015-al-east-champions-the-greatest-moments-part-1">the great moments</a> produced by the three sluggers that constitute the heart of the Blue Jays' batting order, it's time to move on to a series of moments focused on the more defensively oriented players that got the team to an AL East championship.</p> <p><b><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/493/troy-tulowitzki">Troy Tulowitzki's</a> arrival<br></b></p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=310402283&topic_id=11493214&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Troy Tulowitzki had his best game at the plate (so far?) in his very first game after getting traded to Toronto from the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/colorado-rockies">Colorado Rockies</a>. A big debut to match a big trade. Hopefully we'll see more of this from Troy in the playoffs.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=430320183&topic_id=6479266&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Although Tulo has not been with the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays">Blue Jays</a> for very long, he's already made quite a few highlights, and it was very difficult to pick one as his top defensive play. Ultimately I picked this one because it shows off both his range and his arm. I can't see Reyes getting to the ball or making the solid throw even if he did get there.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=333856283&topic_id=73955164&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Troy Tulowitzki wasted little time in getting himself his own high exit velocity home run, and this one wouldn't have been out of place in the series of absolute bombs by Donaldson, Bautista and Encarnacion, as it also topped 110 mph off the bat.</p>
<p><b><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/190429/kevin-pillar">Kevin Pillar's</a> transformation into Superman</b></p>

<p>Kevin Pillar has been mostly about amazing catches in the field. But how about hitting two home runs in one game off <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31245/max-scherzer">Max Scherzer</a>? I'd say that's pretty good for a glove-first outfielder.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=75401683&topic_id=9249094&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>

<p>Kevin Pillar has been an ongoing source of defensive highlights, but when it comes to spectacular catches, you really can't leave out these two. And we didn't even show you any of Pillar's amazing baserunning!</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=495134483&topic_id=69808956&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Yes, even Kevin Pillar has had a monster shot, although there's no statcast to tell us just how hard it went. Even if it wasn't quite the hardest home run hit in Rogers Centre this year, Pillar hit his shot in an important game against a very good young pitcher.</p>
<p><b>The <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/885/russell-martin">Russell Martin</a> signing</b></p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=497819983&topic_id=69808956&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Despite the fact that the Blue Jays already had the lead, and therefore this home run did not grant Martin a huge amount of WPA, this is the home run that Blue Jays fans are most likely to remember given the situation and the intensity of the playoff race at the time.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=91343683&topic_id=63371196&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Russell Martin <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/CS_c_top_ten.shtml">led the league</a> in throwing out runners trying to steal in both 2013 and 2014, and shared that honour with <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/68930/alex-avila">Alex Avila</a> in 2011. He might finally be building up a Yadier Molina-like reputation, though, as he's "only" second in the amount of thieves cut down this year. The reason I chose this particular steal is that Betts, one of the fastest players in the game, has only been caught stealing six times. Two of those were on throws by Russell Martin. Fun fact: <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/192207/mookie-betts">Mookie Betts</a> <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/leaders.aspx?pos=all&stats=bat&lg=all&qual=y&type=8&season=2015&month=0&season1=2015&ind=0&team=0&rost=0&age=0&filter=&players=0&sort=18,d">trails only</a> Kevin Pillar and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/106898/ben-revere">Ben Revere</a> in Fangraphs' baserunning statistic, and we can't ask Martin to throw those guys out, now can we?</p>

<p>Remember when Russell Martin was slumping early in the season? He broke out of it in a big way by hitting two bombs, both opposite field, in a game against the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/atlanta-braves">Braves</a>.</p>
<p><b>Ryan 'frickin' Goins</b></p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=440159583&topic_id=73955164&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" width="400" height="224" frameborder="0">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Have a day, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/107700/ryan-goins">Ryan Goins</a>. One of the most incredible catches of the season and a walk-off home run in just one game. Despite the fact that this was not a game against the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/new-york-yankees">Yankees</a>, it is a contender for game of the season for me, personally.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=502676683&topic_id=6479266&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" width="400" height="224" frameborder="0">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>I think David Price might have a new favourite baseball player, and his name is Ryan Goins. Here's <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/9249094/v368584583/nyytor-goins-makes-a-barehanded-play-to-nab-young/?c_id=mlb">one</a>, here's <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/v433987183/cletor-goins-picks-grounder-turns-nice-double-play/?c_id=mlb">two</a>, here's <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/9249094/v434116083/cletor-goins-makes-dazzling-glove-flip-to-end-frame/?c_id=mlb">three</a> and here's <a href="http://m.mlb.com/video/topic/9249094/v483543883/toratl-goins-makes-outstanding-play-in-the-hole/?c_id=mlb">four</a> incredible defensive plays Goins made behind Price, which is why, in the clip above (watch it til the end), Price reacts the way he does when Goins makes his fifth great play in support of Toronto's new ace. That look on Price's face is the reason I chose this particular clip, because, realistically, you could have twenty clips of Ryan Goins playing defense in this spot. Scratch that, I think I've counted fifteen contenders in September and August alone.

<p>Ryan Goins might not be a power hitter, but he still hit this ball really hard, a no-doubter to one of the deepest parts of the Rogers Centre. And he did it on my birthday too, so he gets bonus points from me for that. Incidentally, this game was <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31830/david-price">David Price's</a> first start for the Blue Jays. Is there something about Price that makes Ryan Goins play like a star?</p>
<p>Stay tuned for the next part of this series, as it's simply impossible to capture and contain the magic of the 2015 Toronto Blue Jays within one or even two articles.</p>

<p>Well that was a waste of a day.</p>
<p>Not much interesting about that game, but some quick notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/130264/drew-hutchison" class="sbn-auto-link">Drew Hutchison</a> started the game, in the pouring rain and gave up 4 hits, 3 runs, 1 walk and 1 hit batter. I can't blame him for any of it. The only person who didn't think the game should have been called was Joe West. Baseball should never be played in those conditions. It was just stupid. When the inning finished, they called it and there was a 3 hour and 20 minute rain delay.</span></li>
<li><span>We used 6 relievers. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/544/jeff-francis" class="sbn-auto-link">Jeff Francis</a>, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/152352/bo-schultz" class="sbn-auto-link">Bo Schultz</a> and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/106640/chad-jenkins" class="sbn-auto-link">Chad Jenkins</a> each gave up a run. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/190271/aaron-sanchez" class="sbn-auto-link">Aaron Sanchez</a> pitched a good inning. </span></li>
<li><span>On offense, our team of scrubs managed 4 runs. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/151849/dalton-pompey" class="sbn-auto-link">Dalton Pompey</a> was 3 for 4 with a double and a walk. Unfortunately, he hit into a double play in the 9th.</span></li>
<li><span><a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/188823/chris-colabello" class="sbn-auto-link">Chris Colabello</a> was 2 for 4 with a double. <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/151096/munenori-kawasaki" class="sbn-auto-link">Munenori Kawasaki</a>, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/69238/josh-thole" class="sbn-auto-link">Josh Thole</a>, <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/33920/ezequiel-carrera" class="sbn-auto-link">Ezequiel Carrera</a> and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/107808/jonathan-diaz" class="sbn-auto-link">Jonathan Diaz</a>. </span></li>
<li><span>0 fors go to Clair Pennington and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/107700/ryan-goins" class="sbn-auto-link">Ryan Goins</a> (sharing an 0 for 4), <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/129986/matt-hague" class="sbn-auto-link">Matt Hague</a> and <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/33992/darwin-barney" class="sbn-auto-link">Darwin Barney</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
<div>No JoD, though I think those of us that watched more than a couple of innings of that deserve some sort of award.</div>

<div>Suckage goes Hutch (-.258, really not fair) and Barney (-.091).</div>

  <p>The Toronto Blue Jays have done it. After twenty two years of mediocrity, unfulfilled promises and worse, the Blue Jays are going to play in the AL Divisional series as AL East champions. And this group of players has earned it, they have played so incredibly well, especially in the second half, that there are no doubts about the Blue Jays deserving the AL East championship. </p> <p>To celebrate the clinching of the AL East championship, let's revisit the biggest home runs, the greatest hitting performances and the best fielding plays of your 2015 <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>, starting with the likely American League MVP.</p>
<p><b> <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31593/josh-donaldson">Josh Donaldson</a></b></p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=197042483&topic_id=43487246&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Not only was this one of the greatest catches of the year, at the time it kept the perfect game by <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/39094/marco-estrada">Marco Estrada</a> alive, it was a game ultimately decided by just one run (in the 12th inning), so a very clutch play by Donaldson helping his pitching get an extra out.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=133042383&topic_id=63371196&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Donaldson has many, many notable performances at the plate, but this 4-for-4 day including a walk-off three run home run takes the cake. Incredibly, Donaldson would homer off Robertson again the very next day to tie that game up 3-3, but the Jays would lose that game 5-3 in extras innings.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=238936283&topic_id=73955164&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Both Statcast and <a href="http://www.hittrackeronline.com/homeruns.php?league=AL">Hit Tracker</a> agree that this is Donaldson's hardest hit blast. It's a thing of beauty.</p>
<p><b><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/389/jose-bautista">Jose Bautista</a></b></p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=496693583&topic_id=73955164&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Jose Bautista may have lost a bit of speed in the outfield, and his shoulder has given him problems, but he showed against the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/new-york-yankees">Yankees</a> that he can still throw out speedy runners with his cannon of an arm.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=474062383&topic_id=69808956&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Technically Jose had a higher WPA in several other games. But given that this pair of home runs played a huge part in winning this game against the Blue Jays' big AL East rival, I think we can call this Bautista's biggest impact at the plate. It has been weird to see the great Jose Bautista no longer being unquestionably the top hitter on the Jays, but he's still one of the league's top hitters and a great pleasure to watch.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=121675283&topic_id=73955164&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>This is without a doubt Bautista's hardest hit home run this season. Boy, Jose crushing balls out of the park never gets old. And he seems to like hitting against the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/los-angeles-angels">Angels</a>, does that mean we should root for them to win the Wild Card?</p>
<p><b><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/442/edwin-encarnacion">Edwin Encarnacion</a></b></p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=152755283&topic_id=70087564&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>Josh Donaldson has made a bit of a habit of hitting walk-off shots, but Encarnacion is no stranger to the big hit, either. This bomb off <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/miami-marlins">Marlins</a> closer <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/108297/a-j-ramos">A.J. Ramos</a> was huge. Ramos has a solid 2.37 ERA on the season, unfortunately for him Edwin Encarnacion does not care one bit about who he's facing.</p>
<p><iframe src="http://m.mlb.com/shared/video/embed/embed.html?content_id=82916083&topic_id=6479266&width=400&height=224&property=mlb" frameborder="0" height="224" width="400">Your browser does not support iframes.</iframe></p>
<p>I don't feel like you could describe this home run in words if you ever had to tell someone about that time that Encarnacion took Brian Matusz deep.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With three of the major league's top hitters in the lineup, it's only fitting that all three of them have hit one home run that just blows your mind. Which is your favourite Blue Jay bomb?</p>

  <p>For fans, Marcus Stroman, the team, Wednesday's division-clinching win was perfect.</p> <p class="MsoNormal"><span>Mother Nature delayed the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays">Toronto Blue Jays</a>’ near-inevitable sixth American League East (AL East) tittle on Tuesday when heavy rain forced Toronto into a Wednesday doubleheader at Camden Yards against the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/baltimore-orioles">Baltimore Orioles</a>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>It was playing out perfectly. In need of a Jays win and a <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/new-york-yankees">Yankees</a> loss to clinch the division, Toronto was set to take on Baltimore just as the <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/boston-red-sox">Red Sox</a> stormed out to a 6-0 lead in the top of the first inning at Yankee Stadium. A shade over 200 miles away, the Yankees were gifting the Jays their first AL East title in 22 years. <span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>After the Yankees went on to lose 10-4, at home, the Jays kicked off their first of two cracks at the division title on Wednesday.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>And they didn’t need either of those wins. They could have made it close, and lost a couple, narrowing their schedule in the process. Prior to the 4:00 p.m. first leg of the doubleheader, the Jays had six games left and needed just one win to secure the title.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>But a win was inevitable. Or close to it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Since the non-waiver trade deadline on July 31, the Jays had played to a record of 38-14.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>The acquisitions of outfielder <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/106898/ben-revere">Ben Revere</a>, shortstop <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/493/troy-tulowitzki">Troy Tulowitzki</a>, and pitchers <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/338/latroy-hawkins">LaTroy Hawkins</a> and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/1098/mark-lowe">Mark Lowe</a> at the deadline had not only shored up the team’s bullpen, but also added to an already potent offence – the strongest in the AL at the time in terms of runs scored.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the two months since the deadline, the Jays had lost two consecutive games just three times, having never let it extend to three games, let alone six.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Losing fell out of style. Waiting wasn’t their style. They weren’t going to lose twice to the 76-80 Orioles.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>In the top of the second inning of the first game, catcher <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/885/russell-martin">Russell Martin</a>’s one-out triple cashed Ben Revere from first base, setting the table for <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/107700/ryan-goins">Ryan Goins</a> to give Toronto the early 2-0 lead on the road with another one-out hit.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>From there, there was no looking back. And the fans, travelling to the away game for a chance at history, knew it, with "Let’s go Blue Jays" chants descending early and often.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">They would add another pair in the fourth inning, four more in the fifth, two more in the seventh and five more in the ninth.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>But the end result didn’t matter. What mattered was that they won, and there was never any doubt.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>And while it had grown increasingly clear the team was destined for the title as the season wound down, it was particular special for one player: <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/190273/marcus-stroman">Marcus Stroman</a>.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>For Stroman, the game was the capitulation of a long road that led him this moment, to his moment.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>After suffering a torn ACL in Spring Training while fielding a routine play, Stroman worked tirelessly to get back, <a href="http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/mlb/toronto-blue-jays-marcus-stroman-vows-to-come-back-stronger-from-knee-injury-im-going-to-be-fine">promising fans that he’d be back</a> in time for the playoffs the day after the injury.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">The return shall be legendary.</p>
— Marcus Stroman (@MStrooo6) <a href="https://twitter.com/MStrooo6/status/576013556354809856">March 12, 2015</a>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>As with the Jays’ clinch, it didn’t matter how he did it, just that he was on the mound when it happened, seven months after his injury.</span></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Appreciate the love. Don't be upset though. I promise to be back even stronger with a bigger smile. Faith and confidence define me! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EHFAR?src=hash">#EHFAR</a></p>

</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>That he had to go 4-0 upon his return from the injury to make the moment possible is just a bonus. That he went eight innings giving up one earned run on the evening is just a bonus.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>All that mattered was that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">he</i> was there when <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">they</i> did it.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>And <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal;">they </i>aren’t just the team, but also its fans.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>Jays fan Katelyn Esmonde travelled from Washington to Baltimore with tickets for both the games, but she was confident before the first game started that the team </span><a style="background-color: #ffffff;" href="https://twitter.com/phylliskessel13/status/649309837659086848" target="_blank">wouldn’t need the second.</a></p>
<p>    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>She wasn’t the only one who <a href="https://twitter.com/phylliskessel13/status/649355276429168641">made the trip</a> either. For the flocks of Jays fans in the stadium, the moment was a longtime coming.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>"The stadium was pretty empty, so all the Jays fans gathered by the Jays dugout and were cheering loudly the whole time," Esmonde said in an interview in between games. "There was so much camaraderie amongst us Jays fans -- we were exchanging stories about where we're from, our trip into town for the game, and even how old we were the last time the Jays won the World Series."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>"From where I was, it felt like a home game," she said. "A lot of things came together to make that an incredible night for Jays fans."</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">    </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span>And isn’t that the truth?</span></p>

  <p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays">Blue Jays</a> 1 <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/baltimore-orioles">Orioles</a> 8</p>
<p>As the 2015 season moves towards its inexorable end, the Blue Jays engaged the Orioles in a meaningless late September game for yet another year.</p>
<p>Okay, so this one's a little different since it was made meaningless by virtue of the Blue Jays clinching the division earlier in the evening rather than being eliminated with a week or two to go.</p>
<p><b>THE &nbsp;Y-BLUE JAYS SIT ATOP THE AL EAST EAST AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER</b></p>
<p>Many years ago, about 50 miles northwest of where the Jays played tonight, Abraham Lincoln gave the Gettysburg Address in which he famously predicted that "the world will little note nor long remember" what happened on that day. Of course, he was wrong, but I feel very confident in saying it's a very fitting way to describe the second game of today's doubleheader.</p>
<p><b>THE BLUE JAYS ARE GOING TO THE PLAYOFFS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN 22 YEARS</b></p>
<p>John Gibbons made good on his promise of starting a skeleton crew if the Jays clinched the division in game one, and that's how you got <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/33920/ezequiel-carrera">Ezequiel Carrera</a> hitting third and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/69238/josh-thole">Josh Thole</a> sixth. That freed the regulars to not so subtly pre-game the post-game celebration that awaited (and boy did it show when they talked to them!)</p>
<p><b>BECAUSE THE BLUE JAYS WON THE AMERICAN LEAGUE EAST TO HAVE A REAL PLAYOFF SPOT WORTH CELEBRATING</b></p>
<p>R. A. Dickey pitched very well, only needing 58 pitches to work five shutout innings. He allowed two hits, though the defenders made a few nice plays to save him a few more, while striking out three and walking none. He was totally zoned in for a game it would have been pretty easy to totally mail in. Even though he was totally cruising, Gibby took him out for <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/151492/ryan-tepera">Ryan Tepera</a> because</p>
<p><b>THE BLUE JAYS ARE THE DIVISION CHAMPS AND IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PLAYOFFS!</b></p>
<p>The 7th inning would prove to be the Jays undoing. Carrera lead off with a double with the score still 0-0, their best socring opportunity of the night with <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/188823/chris-colabello">Chris Colabello</a> and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/129986/matt-hague">Matt Hague</a> to follow. Colabello smacked a ball, but just foul, and then popped out. Hague too popped out, and Carrera totally forgot how many outs there were, getting doubled off.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the inning, Tepera came back out after working a clean 6th. He was immediately greeted with back-to-back home runs from <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/130203/manny-machado">Manny Machado</a> and <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31579/chris-davis">Chris Davis</a>. That was the end of his night, <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/142399/liam-hendriks">Liam Hendriks</a> came in and gave up a double (partially misplayed by Carrera), a walk and a single. So in came Loup, who got a strikeout before allowing snakebitten single and double on ground balls that could have easily been outs or double plays in other circumstances to make it 5-0.</p>
<p><b>BUT THAT COULDN'T CHANGE THE JAYS STILL BEING THE DIVISION CHAMPS</b></p>
<p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/33992/darwin-barney">Darwin Barney</a> hit a home run to put the Jays on the board. <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/131669/steve-delabar">Steve Delabar</a> came in for the 8th and did a little more damage to their run differential, giving up another bomb to Chris Davis leading off. Jonathon Schoop hit one off the outfield wall in right centre, and then <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/32335/matt-wieters">Matt Wieters</a> hit a bomb of his own. He almost gave up a third to <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/837/j-j-hardy">J.J. Hardy</a>, but whatever because</p>
<p><b>THE BLUE JAYS ARE THE 2015 AL EAST CHAMPIONS!</b></p>
<p><b>Jays of the Day</b>: As discussed, Dickey had a great night</p>
<p><b>Suckage</b>: By the numbers, a handful. <b>BUT WHO CARES, PLAYOFFS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</b></p>
<p>After an unbelievable August and September,&nbsp;<b>BRING ON OCTOBER!</b></p>

  <p>Pop the corks, the Jays are going to the ALDS!!!</p> <p><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/toronto-blue-jays">Blue Jays</a> 15 <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/baltimore-orioles">Orioles</a> 2</p>
<p>I'm not doing a recap...you guys saw it. <a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/190273/marcus-stroman">Marcus Stroman</a> was unhittable. Our offense was great. And the Orioles helped out by not being able to field.</p>
<p>Some quick points:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><span>8 innings of 1 run ball from Marcus Stroman...how amazing has he been. He's gone through so much he deserves this. </span></li>
<li><span>We had 15 runs, 18 hits, 10 walks. </span></li>
<li><span><a class="sbn-auto-link" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/107700/ryan-goins">Ryan Goins</a> was 5 for 5 with a double and a beauty of a bunt single.</span></li>
<li><span>Revere, Donaldson, and Pillar had 2 hits each.</span></li>
<li><span>Encarnacion hit his 37th home run, getting RBI 107 and 108.</span></li>
<li><span>Home runs from Bautista and Smoak in the top of the 9th. </span></li>
</ul>
<div>The GameThread for game two has to go up in just a few minutes, so I'm going to end it here and the new GameThread will go</div>
<div><br></div>
<div>Give a JoD to all the players, to Gibby and to Alex. And let's take one each for ourselves.</div>
<div><br></div>
<p> </p>
<h4>It is time to go open a bottle of something with bubbles and toast this team and this team's fans.</h4>
<p> </p>
<h4>And, of course, all of us here. I'm incredibly blessed to get to be on this site. Thanks everyone and enjoy this. It has been a long time coming.</h4>
