Until about 2007. On a Saturday afternoon of no particular distinction, yours truly happened to come across the dulcet tones of <span style="font-weight:bold;">Tyler King </span>calling a Queen's hockey game on CFRC. The result of that game has  been forgotten by everyone save the players and coaches. What endures is that some typical insecure angry young man comment that I made on <span style="font-style:italic;">OOLF</span> prompted Tyler, not that he needed the help, to e-mail asking for any tips to he could use to improve as broadcaster.<br /><br />There was probably little I could impart since I work in a medium blessed with a backspace key, to be honest, but that hardly matters. What matters is that was the beginning of a beautiful friendship, one that has enriched the person who's the older of the two by a decade more than the younger individual. You are probably acquainted with either Tyler or me personally and professionally. If you are devoted or bored enough to be checking this long-dormant site tonight you probably know this is about sending Tyler, AKA Kinger, AKA Cookie, AKA Miguel Sanchez, off well as he wings west. Monday, he'll begin what seems like a great opportunity, working for Rogers Radio as a newscaster and hockey play-by-play announcer calling the action for the Fort McMurray Oil Barons of the Alberta Junior Hockey League.<br /><br /><span id="fullpost">No one gets that an opportunity while still on the cool side of 25 without working so hard for it that people feel compelled to open doors, like the way then-Kingston Kimco Voyageurs owner <b>Gregg Rosen </b>and coach<b> Evan Robinson</b>, my fellow Napaneean, did in 2010 when they agreed to let Tyler set up an Internet broadcast of their playoff games, which was without precedent for the Junior A team.<br /><br />It has been and will continue to be a trip to have a rinkside seat to watch Tyler work on his craft, refusing to take the easy way out on any task, even though many do while trying to gain or keep a foothold in the tough-to-crack broadcasting field.<br /><br />No doubt this reads like a total tire-pumping. That is not needed. Tyler has <span style="font-style:italic;">very</span> fully developed ego integrity. It just bears putting in words that without our association, borne from a random CFRC/Queen's/Kingston/sports connection, the past few years would not have been as fun. Knowing Kinger was a conduit for keeping somewhat in tune with the Kingston sportscape. It meant having someone to bounce lines off, someone who could always be meta when it came to having a germane sitcom reference to break out with wit and impeccable timing. It also meant having someone to down a few beers with after the seminal Saturday in November 2009 when the Big Yellow Guys took down Laval. Tyler should know that I feel fortunate to have witnessed his career changes, I am glad I knew him while my professional set-up changed for the better.<br /><br />None of that is profound, I know. Hey, the only true currency in this bankrupt world is what we share when we're uncool. That's from the Lester Bangs character in <span style="font-style:italic;">Almost Famous</span>. Tyler has never seen that film, no matter how many times I have recommended it.<br /><br />That's okay, though, since the kid is stubborn-to-a-fault true to himself, like most people who get anywhere in this life. What draws people to Tyler is that he has taken it to heart that being in the media isn't about the events or stories you get to cover on the corporate dime. It's about trying to keep yourself fresh. It's also about considering why the stories matter to the people involved, knowing all the while that understanding will not make you rich, it will win something much more valuable — respect.<br /><br />By all accounts, Tyler has learned that, lived it and loved it on all of his stops. One mark that someone is capable of bigger and better things is those who effect lasting change before they move up the ladder. Very rarely does someone get to do that in campus media or at one of her/his first jobs. A proof of how good Tyler is the influence he managed to have in Kingston over a short period of time. The aforementioned Vees had never had live play-by-play prior to his arrival. Next season, that will carry on with <b>Allan Etmanski</b> calling the games.<br /><br />Similarly, lots of young guys have had sports shows on CFRC 101.9 over the years. Most were just the same variation on Here's What's Happening In Sports And Here's What I Think About It — basically Bleacher Report in spoken-word form. Tyler's show, <em>Offsides</em>, grew into much more over its three-year run (interrupted by his stint at Syracuse). Tyler broke news with respect to the Voyageurs and Kingston Frontenacs and kept Queen's Athletics on its toes. Many informed sports fans came to see it as the city's most credible source for sports news.<br /><br />One hope in writing this is that someone else comes along to fill that void in Kingston before too long. Sports coverage is a niche, nowhere as big in the grand scheme as hard news, but Kingston's dedicated sports fans are not always well-served by either of the city's two old-media outlets. That's not a slam on the hard-working people employed on the editorial side at the Quebecor-owned newspaper and Corus-owned TV station. Far from it. I am just trying to be honest about what everyone working in a newsroom knows but might not say aloud: the wild world of monetized media coverage means there is precious little a mass-audience newscast or newspaper can do for sports fans who want to know more about the teams in their backyard than who won and who lost.

Remember, too, the road-kill beards of Bruce Sutter (300 saves) and Gene Garber (218), the hood-ornament-steer-horns 'stache of Sparky Lyle (222) and the fearsome Fus of Goose Gossage (308) and Mike Marshall (178).<br /><br />Long before the invention of the Gillette Atra twin-blade razor, these flamboyant relievers were causing heads to pivot. But few got the attention, adulation or remuneration afforded today's premier closers. In fact, the term closer doesn't do justice to the glamorous head-liners of the 1990s. Does Sinatra close for Steve and Eydie? No. They open for him, much as starter Tom Browning opens for stopper Rob Dibble in Cincinnati.

No less than five of the nine starters, along with one of the starting pitchers, is drawn from that decade, when the Jays were usually awesomely good until October. Borderline Hall of Famer Fred McGriff, who had his best season in Toronto, anchors the starting lineup, while the good version of Juan Guzman is the staff ace.<br /><br />Of course, by process of elimination, you might be able to figure out who is on the Jays' all-time team that will published at a later date.<br /><br />The 51s' division includes Fresno (a Giants B team), Sacramento (an Athletics B team) and Reno. They might be up against it in a division with two original franchises, especially since the lineup isn't very deep.<br /><br /><strong>STARTING LINEUP</strong><br /><ol><li>CF <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mosebll01.shtml">Lloyd Moseby</a>,* 1984 (6.2).

A guaranteed stumper among Blue Jays fans is to ask them to name all seven Jays who have had a 40-homer season. Bell, Jesse Barfield, Jose Bautista, and Carlos Delgado come to mind no problem. It might take a minute to recall Green and Jose Canseco, but Bautista, who had the world's most open batting stance, is a tough pull.</li><br /><li>OF-1B <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/mullira01.shtml">Adam Lind</a>,* 2009 (3.3).

No ex-ballplayer ever claimed to be the basis for Kenny Powers — they're not typically so desperate for money — but Koch <a href="http://www.ktvu.com/news/9264350/detail.html">might have had a case</a>.

The last two spots in the 'pen are a bit of a weak point, but Castillo was either better than most people remember or he just got to work in all the low-leverage situations. Was credited with the win in Game 4 of the 1993 World Series, the 15-14 game, since obviously it is all on the pitching when a team scores 15 runs. </li></ul>(* left-handed hitter; # switch-hitter)<br /></span>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"http://neatesager.blogspot.com/2011/03/ultimate-baseball-league-las-vegas-51s.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"noreply@blogger.com (outofleftfield)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2011-03-07T09:41:21.989-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:98:"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Mefum57KBSA/TWw4O4TrOhI/AAAAAAAAA7I/2_HUmdgWU-8/s72-c/mlb_51s_moseby.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-16538424.post-3034091225990258089";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 28 Feb 2011 05:18:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Baseball";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"Baseball Prospectus";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Bill James";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"Poz";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9:"Rob Neyer";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:6:"domain";s:31:"http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"Sixty (starting) nines, dude: the all-time baseball league";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8056:"<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zFOS4Zd4zI/TWvBTkj-iVI/AAAAAAAAA7A/iTVhbOGtxyQ/s1600/springtraining.jpg"><img style="MARGIN: 0px 0px 10px 10px; WIDTH: 320px; FLOAT: right; HEIGHT: 240px; CURSOR: hand" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5578765105404741970" border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4zFOS4Zd4zI/TWvBTkj-iVI/AAAAAAAAA7A/iTVhbOGtxyQ/s400/springtraining.jpg" /></a> <div>Baseball is the intellectual's game since all the action takes place in the observer's head — which could also be why it takes nearly three hours to complete seven minutes of action.<br /><br />That's the best way of introducing a fun little side project borne from a secret shame: creating a 25-player roster for all 30 current MLB franchises, plus another 30 historical rosters. Sixty nines, as it were.<br /><br />This sort of ties with the <a href="http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=12994">concept of metafandom</a>, along with having personal and professional obligations that proscribe any blogging on baseball. Talking about a game will never replace watching the best players in the world do their thing. However, there is a lot to be said for the idea a lot of Seamheads, as <strong>Craig Calcaterra</strong> put it recently, have come "to love or obsess about the game — through something other than actually sitting down and watching it."<br /><br />For yours truly, the gateway drug into being a stat geek was a computer simulation from called <em>Earl Weaver Baseball </em>that was released in the late 1980s. There is general awareness that <em>John Madden Football</em> was catalytic for sports video games, but <em>Weaver</em> was innovative in its own right (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Weaver_Baseball">you could play an entire season and it recreated different stadiums</a>). Its era-specific rosters using Hall of Fame players, this being before people realized using one's name and likeness without compensation was probably actionable, was a better introduction to baseball history than<strong> Ken Burns</strong>' <em>Baseball</em> (not being hyperbolic, it really was).<br /><br />From about 1989 through 1996, a shameful number of hours were wiled away playing games between, for instance the AL 00-30 team with its <strong>Ty Cobb</strong>-<strong>Tris Speaker</strong>-<strong>Babe Ruth</strong> outfield (and two .400 hitters, <strong>Harry Heilmann</strong> and <strong>George Sisler</strong>, sitting on the bench) and the likes of the AL 61-75 team, on which the 1961 version of <strong>Roger Maris</strong> was the fourth outfielder behind<strong> Mickey Mantle</strong>,<strong> Frank Robinson</strong> and <strong>Carl Yastrzemski</strong>. Even more time was pissed away typing in contemporary players' stats from the backs of baseball cards to make rosters of current players to make imaginary teams.<br /><br />As a 15-year-old loner growing up in a rural area, it was either that or learn how to hunt or fish. Remember, this was before kids out in the boonies had the Internet or meth labs. Besides, who wouldn't have been curious to see what kind of power numbers<strong> Frank Thomas </strong>would have put up if he was 'created' and placed on a team that played in Fenway Park?<br /><br />Suffice to say, that's always been there. So, if all this goes according to plan, by Opening Day each roster should be posted.<br /><br /><span id="fullpost">Here is a rough format: <ul><li><strong>Franchises will be grouped by vintage. </strong>The Blue Jays and their 34-season history aren't competing with Red Sox and Yankees, whose lineups can be drawn from nearly a century. Feel free to read that as a protest against MLB wrecking a good thing, being a sport, no salary cap, with a bad thing, unbalanced schedules and too many divisions.<br /><br />That expanded playoff format cannot happen soon enough. </li><br /><li><strong>No player may be used twice. Rob Neyer </strong>of <a href="http://www.sbnation.com/">sbnation.com</a>, a few years ago, published his <em>Big Book of Baseball Lineups</em>. When it came out, I was all, "How dare he have the drive and work ethic to see to fruition an idea I never acted on!" However, Neyer's objective was just picking the best lineup. This exercise is under the guise that there's some realm where these teams would actually play, so<strong> Barry Bonds </strong>can't be on the Pittsburgh Pirates and San Francisco Giants.<br /><br />A couple years ago, yours truly also managed the Blue Jays in a <a href="http://www.seamheads.com/">Seamheads.com</a> sim league. Again, players could be used more than once. This is more pure.</li><br /><li><strong>Each player will be chosen by his most representative season.</strong> The criteria is to use WAR (Wins Above Replacement) to pick a 25-player roster with a batting order using a designated hitter, bench, starting rotation and bullpen.<br /></li><li><strong>Context counts.</strong> That's a way of dealing with suspect Steroid Era seasons or one-year wonders. For instance, <strong>Brady Anderson</strong>'s 50-home run 1996 season (6.6 WAR) should get tossed out, but his '92 campaign (5.4) that better reflected his overall body of work is permissible. Some emphasis will be given to more contemporary players, since baseball has become more competitive over time. In other words, anyone from the pre-<strong>Jackie Robinson </strong>era or Dead Ball Era (before 1920) will have to be more exceptional than a latter-day player. </li></ul><p>Here are the divisions:</p><b>AMERICAN LEAGUE</b><br /><ul><li><strong>Classic: </strong>The charter franchises — Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Chicago White Sox, Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers.</li><br /><li><strong>Modern: </strong>Teams that took their current form in the 1950s and '60s — Baltimore Orioles, Minnesota Twins, Los Angeles Angels, Oakland Athletics.<br /><br /></li><li><b>Newbies: </b>The under-40 (as in seasons) teams — Kansas City Royals, Texas Rangers, Seattle Mariners, Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Rays.

a NHL hockey team in Glendale, Ariz., <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/hockey/coyotes-glendale-bond-sale-hits-snag/article1921333/">has gone awry</a>. Reading back to July 30, 2009, it's not surprising when you realize whose interests the NHL and most politicians are really representing these days.</em><br /><br />The NHL really showed Wednesday how as a business, it is a game of TEGWAR, The Exciting Game Without Any Rules.<br /><br /><span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Jim Balsillie</span>'s camp smartly pointed out minutes after he was denied that this had nothing to do with his fitness to be an owner, and that the judge in Arizona said in June that the league would have to show he didn't have the cash. Of course, the nets had already been moved, like a group of kids moving their ball hockey game down the street (which <a href="http://makeiteighteh.com/2009/07/30/the-legal-eyebrow-is-officially-raised/">might cheese the judge off</a>, but that is neither here nor there). <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Bruce Arthur</span>'s <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">National Post </span>column pointed out, well, if it wasn't money, then it had be something else, but this is the league that let future felon <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Boots Del Biaggio</span> into the fold.<br /><br />Granted, being the person who waits for Canadians to wake up to what <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Gary Bettman</span>'s NHL stands for is like being sent out on a snipe hunt. Please, though, sometime between now and the next labour stoppage, clue in that denying Balsillie, <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/story-printer.html?id=1842506" target="_blank"><span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">again</span></a>, really betrays that the NHL always represents its interests to the bitter end. It's just that those interests have nothing to do with the <a href="http://makeiteighteh.com/2009/07/18/is-the-coyotes-deal-more-about-development-subsidies-than-hockey/" target="_blank">great game of hockey and everything to do with corporate malfeasance</a> that could launch six <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Naomi Klein</span> screeds and a couple <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Bruce Cockburn</span> ditties. They won't care you could have three teams in Southern Ontario which would each draw more than the Phoenix Coyotes (with higher ticket prices) until the day when the U.S. economy is really up a creek.<br /><br />The Coyotes are just a game piece in a scheme where, to quote an alternative weekly <a href="http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/content/printVersion/1290876">said the week Balsillie's bid for the Coyotes became public</a>, a "broke" city is "also trying to line the pockets of some of the wealthiest investment groups in New York City, Saudi Arabia, and Abu Dhabi." (<i>Phoenix New Times</i>, May 14.)<br /><br /><span id="fullpost">The above link came via <a style="FONT-STYLE: italic" href="http://makeiteighteh.com/" target="_blank">Make It Eight, Eh?</a>. From the look of it, a Hamilton, Ont., insurance broker named <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Craig Ferguson</span>, over the run of this sordid saga, has evolved from a thinking fan's case for the NHL to put more teams into Canada to advocacy for taxpayers in Arizona in the wake of a swindle/boondoggle which is going down in the American southwest. You really should, if you have time, read through it since Ferguson makes it clear why the hell <b>Jerry Reinsdorf</b> wants to own an unprofitable hockey team which has never been about hockey from the day it arrived in the desert.<br /><blockquote>"The attraction to the Coyotes hockey team has always been an issue of land development opportunites and great deals with government, and the profits that would go along with them. Nobody in their right mind would take this team with the clear math currently in place. As soon as (former owners Jerry) Moyes and (Steve) Ellman broke up the land from the ice, that’s when the 'Coyote' should have chased the Roadrunner out of town.<br /><br />"Are we to believe, as mentioned by the Reinsdorf camp, and now even by the new Canadian/American mixed coalition represented by Daryl Jones (Research Edge LLC) that trying to share in a little bit of food and parking is going to cut the mustard? 'Little things add up' is the argument? Were we born yesterday? And, if I might add, if Daryl Jones and his group thinks they are going to break into this game with nickel and dime thinking, they had better think again. Like all politics, what would make sense from a genuine, honest angle usually doesn’t win the prize."</blockquote>In other words: Cha-ching! Ferguson has flipped over a couple other rocks, <a href="http://makeiteighteh.com/2009/07/14/the-promise-of-revenues-outside-of-hockey-the-glendale-connection/">noting two weeks ago</a> that Jerry Reinsdorf's son is "is a director of a partnering firm, <a href="http://www.ifgroup.cc/teammembers/reinsdorf.htm" target="_blank">International Facilities Group (IFG)</a>, that has a hand in consulting the City of Glendale for the Jobing.com arena, <a href="http://makeiteighteh.com/2009/07/14/conspiracy-and-deceipt-the-nhl-glendale-and-the-bankrupt-coyotes/" target="_blank">and more</a>."<br /><br />It is not like this should shock anyone. For the most part this is the way of the world, at least up until Bear Stearns went nips-up last fall. (At this point, one should allow that maybe the NHL would like Balsillie to pay $350-400 million for an expansion team instead of $212.5M for an established team. At some point, though, these guys have to stop <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/story/2009/07/30/sp-balsillie-walker.html">playing the Canada card</a>.)<br /><br />Most sports fans, regardless of background or intelligence, would be like, "Why should I care that the the city of Phoenix is going to <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124425483396690959.html">hand over $100 million in subsidies</a> in return for 200 public parking spaces at a time when it can't afford to open public pools? I just want to know if the team is going to relocate or not." Thankfully, no one needs a public pool in a desert during a time of high unemployment). That is just the nature of following a sport, nothing wrong or evil about it.<br /><br />However, it does seem crazy how few in Canada have really gone to lengths to explain how the Duel in the Desert, so-called, was more than Gary Bettman and <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Bill Daly</span> delivering a big screw-you to Jim Balsillie. In the grand scheme, this only reaffirms Canadians' Pavlovian slavishness to the NHL. Hockey is a wonderful sport, perhaps the best of the team games, and the NHL is more appealing to watch that it has been at pretty much any point in the Bettman era.<br /><br />At the same time, to repeat <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Peter Gent</span>'s "every time I say it's a business you call it a game and every time I call it a game you say it's a business" corollary, let's have some clear eyes. At the end of the day, this league Canadians hold so near and dear is run by some not-too-nice people who are only to eager to be part of greater outrages. On a macro level, it does affect the competitive product.<br /><br />It was nice to speculate for a couple days when that one bid group for the Coyotes talked about playing games in Halifax or Saskatoon and having an AHL team in Thunder Bay. Maybe that was akin to<span style="FONT-STYLE: italic"> The Simpsons</span> episode when Monty Burns ran for governor: "They're like seals. Toss 'em a couple fish and watch 'em jump."<br /><br />Point being, smarten up. The next person who says Balsillie needs to learn to play by the NHL's rules should get two minutes for bein' stupid. (Outgoing Montreal Canadiens <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">George Gillett </span>actually accuse of him creating a "distraction" that caused the Habs' season to go downhill was a new low. (Mr. Gillett, I have with me a Mr. <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Jared Allen</span> who <a href="http://www.fannation.com/truth_and_rumors/view/110855-jared-allen-favres-deliberations-annoying">has debunked the myth athletes can be distracted</a>, and he's not above using physical force to make a point.)<br /><br />Rules? The NHL has but one that it honours, realizing its place as a pipsqueak in the lumbering dinosaur of the American economy, 2009. Balsille, to borrow a line from those Ford ads which have been playing all summer, might "pulled off a game-changer" by moving the Coyotes to Southern Ontario, but there were other interests to defend.<br /><br />Gary Bettman fits right in with the Boomer mentality where old-economy businesses hide that they are just going around in circles, slowly losing ground before realizing time has run out. The commish is a pipsqueak in the grand scheme of bankrupting America, but like any good CEO, he knows who he works for. That's why they pay him the big bucks.<br /><br />As previously stated, "It would be silly to use the league's idiotic business practices to justify non-interest in what happens on the ice." However, this has been an exercise in the NHL as usual.

It might interest you to know Friday's Carleton-Queen's basketball doubleheader will be called by someone who is typically as dishevelled as Williams was when he was discovered — but minus the golden voice.<br /><br />Yep, yours truly will be doing play-by-play for all four games at the Queen's Centre this weekend, on the radio live for <a href="http://cfrc.ca/blog/">CFRC 101.9</a> for the Ravens-Gaels games Friday and for TV Cogeco Kingston's tape-delayed broadcast of the Queen's Saturday games vs. the Ottawa Gee-Gees.<br /><br />Short story even shorter, purely by happenstance, Will Cunningham, the station's sports director and a promising young broadcaster in his own right, needed a play-by-play announcer for a couple games in January.<br /><br />It seemed like something to do on a lark, just to see if I could pull it off. My experience broadcasting hoops has all been on the colour-commentary end, including working with National Post reporter Mark Masters during the CIS Final 8 in 2009 and '10.<br /><br />In terms of play-by-play, all I've got is about a half-dozen hockey telecasts a half-decade ago for Cable 5 in Simcoe, along with three quarters of Queen's football play-by-play more than a decade ago. (That was during Queen's 1-7 season in 2000; there were a couple games in which the two regulars just couldn't take it anymore; as one of them put it during a 60-point loss to Laurier, "Both teams have put in their backups, so we're putting in our backup.") <br /><br />So please listen — and be kind.<br /><br />Also, yours truly will be on News 570 in Kitchener around 10 a.m. ET Friday to talk about the Kayla Watkins <a href="http://www.thestar.com/sports/hockey/article/920859--should-hockey-dad-be-ashamed-after-girl-s-humiliating-departure?bn=1">story</a>.

You should just be able to find "what lies beyond what the mere calculations can show."<br /><br />From the department of, "yeah ... no," you cannot compare Raines to Gwynn just because one was a National League outfielder born in 1959 and the other was a National League outfielder born in 1960, a whole eight months apart! You may not compare a player who was a MLB regular from 1981-98 with someone who was a regular from 1984-99 just because they each:<br /><ol><li>Played a corner outfield spot and some centrefield;</li><li>Spent their peak years in the NL at about the same time (1983-87 for Raines, '84-89 for Gwynn);</li><li>Usually batted in a similar place in the lineup (91% of Gwynn's career plate appearances and 90% of Raines' were hitting first, second or third);</li><li>Hit similarly well in the leadoff spot (Gwynn OPSed .823, Raines OPSed .813)</li><li>Hit similarly well in the 3-hole (Gwynn OPSed .860, Raines .856)<br /></li><li>Had similar short-and-squat builds (Raines was listed at 5-foot-8, 178 lbs.; Gwynn, 5-11, 199);</li><li>Batted from the left side (Raines was a switch-hitter);</li><li>Had a son of the same name make the major leagues;</li><li>Had a son of the same name make the major leagues as an outfielder;</li><li>Went into coaching after retiring as a player.

Some cannot wait to see what's next.<br /><br />Staying barely on-point, the argument is not that Tim Raines was better than Tony Gwynn.<br /><br />The point is that they had contemporary careers where they each fulfilled the same role about equally well. Except Gwynn was not just a first-ballot inductee, as Sandler describes it, he was elected with 97.6% support three years ago. If you picture the Baseball Hall of Fame as the trendy new nightspot, Gwynn was let inside the velvet rope post-haste. Raines is standing out in the cold while the doorman pretends to scan a clipboard. <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">Raines ... Raines ... Raines ... don't see it.</span><br /><br />As <b>Joe Posnanski</b>, whom Sandler cites in his column without even a hint of irony, <a href="http://joeposnanski.com/JoeBlog/2010/01/04/hall-of-fame-arguments/">noted</a>,<blokckquote>" ... there are only 26 players in baseball history who have received 90% of the vote, and that list does NOT include: <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Frank Robinson</span>, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Joe DiMaggio</span>, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Al Kaline</span>, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Mickey Mantle</span>, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Sandy Koufax</span>, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Yogi Berra</span>, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Bob Gibson</span>, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Walter Johnson</span> and <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Warren Spahn</span>."<br /><br />Gwynn had the high batting average and the 200-hit seasons (a hitting feat you know is vital since <b>Barry Bonds</b>, <b>Babe Ruth</b> and <b>Ted Williams</b> accomplished it a combined <i>never</i>). Raines had the bases on balls, sick stolen-base success rate and scored more runs. Same aims, different means.<br /><br />Raines' argument is not airtight; no one's is. However, the same out clauses that are applied to him have been overlooked for other players. For instance, one <a href="http://www.news-journalonline.com/NewsJournalOnline/Sports/Headlines/sptBASE01010610.htm">sympathetic sportswriter</a> said of Raines, "Should get more votes than he does, but unfortunately his peak years were mostly spent on mediocre teams." Raines' teams finished above .500 in 12 of his 15 seasons as a regular, compared to 8-of-16 for Gwynn. For pity's sake, <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Ryne Sandberg</span> played on only three winning teams in his whole career. No one ever mentioned that when he was on the ballot, since he played for the Chicago Cubs and was a clean-cut white guy.<br /><br />Anyway, the song remains the same with Tim Raines. He received 24.3% support in 2008, 22.6 in 2009. <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Billy Williams</span>, the 1960s and '70s Chicago Cubs outfielder, received similar support (23.4%) in his first go-around in 1982 and was elected five years later. For some reason, he kept gaining about 10% each year. It has not happened for Raines. It needs to this year or next.<br /><br />The second part of this is feeling personally frustrated at working in the media and being surrounded by people who are rigid when fluidity is needed, especially when people can call BS so conveniently. It is disappointing to hear Jeff Blair, who is always a great read, say he "will not vote for a player on subsequent ballots if I didn't vote for him on the first."<br /><br />There are issues with how some ballplayers have crept up to around 20% support to eventually getting the necessary 75% (<span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Jim Rice</span> was a classic example), but come on, Jeff. What, no one should ever re-evaluate their critical opinion, especially if new shit has come to light, man? In other fields, academe, film and literary criticism, people change their minds <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">all the time</span>. They decide they liked a book or movie, or that they hated it. about a book or movie they didn't like the first time around. It's called being human.<br /><br />Getting back to baseball, you have to be careful not to beat people over the head with sabremetrics. It has found its rightful place. It is just a gas to see poor Jeremy Sandler projecting that he's threatened. Sorry to come off like a graduate of the Harry Neale School of Knowing What Everyone Is Thinking, but here is a grown man who says, <span style="FONT-STYLE: italic">"People do not live and die with their favourite players because of mathematical formulae. Adjusted ERA or VORP never made a kid put a poster on his wall." </span>One, as if that proves anything and two, did anyone argue that we should hang our arses on trying to see the world through a child's eyes?<br /><br />Yeah, when you were a kid, you were drawn to specific ballplayers for all sorts of reasons, but no one voted to put <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">George Bell</span> into the Hall of Fame because he had an awesome Jheri-curl and once tried to do a flying karate kick on a Boston Red Sox pitcher named <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Bruce Kison</span>.<br /><br />You grew up, kind of, and you learned to use your mind, instead of losing it when faced with complexity.<br /><br />Enjoy election day. Please keep an eye on <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/01/05/SP931BE0BB.DTL">how big a leap</a> <span style="FONT-WEIGHT: bold">Mark McGwire</span> takes.

It is embarrassing, speaking as a Canadian who covers hockey, loves hockey and played in the OMHA (1983-96). </i><div><i><br /></i></div><div><i>Perhaps it's all of a piece with some larger virulence which is going unchecked (<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/television/john-doyle/don-cherry-its-loony-right-night-in-canada-brought-to-you-by-the-cbc/article1827207/">particularly on CBC each Saturday night</a>). Either way, this July 14, 2008 post from <b>Duane Rollins</b> (actually, a repost of a newspaper article Duane wrote in '07) showed minor hockey officials in Ontario are resistant to even broach racism. Their attitude hands-off indifference at best and at worst it's enabling by labelling it as quote, unquote "part of the game."<br /><br />There are always going to be idiots in the world and the best remedy is to call it out. Greg Walsh acted correctly. Cue Rollins, from two years ago:</i><i> </i></div><div><br /><br /><span id="fullpost">Normally, driving home from a hockey game is a chance for Denis Commanda to catch up with his son Theorem. An energetic and athletic boy, Theorem is usually a chatterbox during his and Denis' long drives back to their West Nipissing home.<br /><br />"He'd want to talk about the game," Denis said. "Everything about it. We'd usually talk about everything."<br /><br />However, the drive back from Theorem’s March 20 game against a North Bay team was different. On that day, instead of the sound of an excited teenager filling the air, there was silence.<br /><br />Denis says he wasn't talking that day because he was too angry. He suspects that Theorem was too sad.<br /><br />Both father and son were responding to an incident that occurred about midway through the third period of the game. It wasn't something that would have been obvious to most of the people watching the game.<br /><br /></span><div><span id="fullpost">Actually, only a select few people were likely aware that anything had happened at all.<br /><br />What happened was this: Theorem and the opposing goaltender became involved in a discussion. The North Bay player became angry and responded by directing a racial slur at Theorem.<br /><br />He called him a "bush nigger," referring to Theorem’s Aboriginal heritage. It was the second time this season that Theorem’s team, which has five Aboriginal players, had experienced racism while playing the North Bay team.<br /><br />In many ways, Denis says that he shouldn't be surprised that these incidents took place. After all, being called a wagon burner, or worse, was a nightly experience for him when he played junior hockey in the '70s. Back then, he dealt with the slurs the way that you would expect a junior hockey player in the '70s to do so -- with his fists.<br /><br />However, he says that the times have changed. Or, at least they should have.<br /><br />"I thought we evolved, you know," he said. "I don't think we should have to deal with that type of thing anymore. It discourages the kids."<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not isolated</span><br /><br />Incidents like the Commandos experienced aren’t isolated to Northern Ontario. In March, several Six Nations players and fans say they had to deal with similar things during two separate playoff series with the Eastern Ontario town of Campbellford.</span></div><div><span id="fullpost"><br /></span></div><div><span id="fullpost"><i>(Campbellford, eh? -- Ed.)<br /></i><br />During the Ontario Minor Hockey Association all-Ontario midget CC semi-final, the Six Nations players say they were subjected to racial slurs from fans located immediately above the player’s bench. Six Nations players say they had beer poured on them from the crowd while the slurs were being shouted.<br /><br />In a video of the game taken by a Six Nations fan, there is clear evidence of a young man pulling a silver can from his pants while standing above the Six Nations bench. However, you cannot understand what the fans are saying in the video.<br /><br />Players and fans of the Six Nations bantam team say they had a similar experience during their OMHA final series with Campbellford.<br /><br />And while covering the final game of that series, I witnessed behaviour of some Campbellford fans that was, if not racist, then certainly distrustful of Six Nations’ people.<br /><br />Unaware of my affiliation with an Aboriginal publication, a Campbellford fan approached me prior to the game to offer a bit of advice.<br /><br />“Watch yourself,” the woman dressed in the Campbellford team colours of black and gold said. “They will spit in your (food) from above.<br /><br />“Be careful,” she added ominously.<br /><br />Later, while shooting photographs in the penalty box, I heard a penalized Campbellford player say, “Stupid Indians. I fucking hate them.”<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Not a new thing</span><br /><br />It's not a new thing, of course. Aboriginals have dealt with racial slurs for as long as they have playing hockey. The unspoken code amongst Native players is that there are two acceptable ways to deal with it -- beat 'em on the scoreboard, or just beat 'em up.<br /><br />"It's a white man's game," former Boston Bruins tough guy Stan Jonathan, a Six Nations native, said. "They would call me a wahoo and a wagon burner and all sorts of things. You just have to learn to take care of yourself if you want to be successful."<br /><br />Taking care of himself was something that Jonathan never had difficulty with. In just over six full NHL seasons, he spent the equivalent of 12 and a half games in the penalty box. He added 91 goals, including 27 in 1977-78, but it was his toughness that Jonathan was best known for.<br /><br />In that he was typical of Aboriginal players. Although there have been exceptions, the normal way a Native player makes it to the NHL is with his fists. There is a long history of Aboriginal enforcers in the NHL, from Jonathan to Bob Probert to current-day players like Jonathan Tootoo and Chris Simon.<br /><br />That toughness is a source of pride amongst many Native hockey fans and players. And it speaks to an overall code of behaviour that has ruled hockey for generations.<br /><br />If you are wronged, you take care of it yourself, the code says. You do not look for outsiders to fight you battles. Outsiders are not to be trusted.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Don’t want to hear it.</span><br /><br />A cheerful voice answered the phone when I called the head office of the Northern Ontario Hockey Association March 30.<br /><br />"Good morning, NOHA. How can I help you?"<br /><br />"I'm calling from an Aboriginal publication in Southern Ontario. I have a letter that was," I said before the voice cut me off.<br /><br />"I know what you are calling about and I don't want to hear any more," it says, more serious now. "I'll take your name and number and pass it on."<br /><br />"I don't want to hear any more." It was a common response to my requests.<br /><br />Three calls to Hockey Canada -- none returned.<br /><br />Calls to several minor hockey officials throughout the province -- none returned.<br /><br />A call to the coach of the player involved in the act of racism directed towards Theorem Commanda--not returned.<br /><br />Additionally, no one from Campbellford was willing to talk. Actually, the town’s minor hockey vice president, Fred Todd, indicated that it was the position of the organization that the OMHA would speak for them.<br /><br />“I have nothing to say,” he said in March 2007. “Talk to the president of the OMHA. What he says is our position.”<br /><br />And the NOHA never did get back to me.<br /><br />Denis says the reluctance to talk should be expected. Canadians, whether they are involved in hockey or not, have a tendency to view themselves as “nice,” he says. And nice people don’t make racial slurs.<br /><br />“They don’t want to deal with it,” Denis said. “But, they need to. I want to make sure that they do.”<br /><br />OMHA executive director Richard Ropchan was the only hockey official to respond to a request to be interviewed. He indicated that the OMHA did not typically get involved in specific hockey games or series. However, the game officials do have the authority to call a game if they feel that the players’ safety is in jeopardy.<br /><br />Local officials can also step in if things become problematic, Ropchan said.<br /><br />In the Campbellford-Six Nations midget series the OMHA took the “unusual” step of sending an observer to the games, Ropchan said. He said that the observer was happy with what he saw during the series.<br /><br />“Both teams and fans appeared to get along,” he said.<br /><br />When asked if the OMHA had ever considered requiring racial sensitivity training for its members, Ropchan seemed to be taken aback. It appeared that it was something that he had not considered before.<br /><br />“We don’t really have anything like that,” he said.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">It should be about the game</span><br /><br />Ultimately, that’s the type of thing that Denis would like to see. Having played hockey at a high level, he says he understands that sometimes emotions get the better of people. However, if they have a better understanding of where someone is coming from, it’s less likely that they will cross a line, he suggests.<br /><br />“We just want a chance to talk to the (North Bay) team,” he said. “We want to teach them a bit about our culture.”<br /><br />The North Bay player that made the slur was asked by his coach to apologize to Theorem after the incident. He did so, and, although Denis says that he is happy that he did, he suggests that it isn’t nearly enough.<br /><br />“The longer it went, the angrier I got,” he says. “The more I wanted to fight it.”<br /><br />In a formal complaint to the NOHA, Denis has asked that the player make a written apology and that the coach, managers, trainers and players of the North Bay team, as well as representatives of the NOHA, have an Aboriginal speaker address them. The speaker would talk about the value of multiethnic cultures and about how destructive racial slurs can be.<br /><br />Denis also asked that the North Bay player be monitored moving forward.<br /><br />As someone that loves the game, Denis says it would be the right move for the NOHA to make.<br /><br />“These kids were picked for the team based on their skills and abilities as hockey players,” he said. “At no time did their racial background come into play.

The second-last is to give said wannabes who feel it is high-larious to record a rap video <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4cDEwhVWJY">with a chorus that includes</a> "Fuck Queen's" <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YVParcOe2U">or a gay slur</a> any undue publicity. </div><div><br /></div><div>Granted, you could point out the University of Western Ontario students shot part of their video in TD Waterhouse Stadium and thus would have had to get permission from school officials. Never mind that connotes giving tacit approval to insulting another Ontario university, the <a href="http://oua.ca.ismmedia.com/ISM2//Documents/OUA%20Code%20of%20Conduct_August2008.pdf">OUA Code of Conduct be damned</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YVParcOe2U">The copycat response</a> from University of Guelph students is probably worse, what with its what-grade-are-you-in homophobia.<i> ("You would have thought I had fangs / Take the 'n' out and you just described the Mustangs" / " ... and Queen's, fuck you too / fuck you fuck you fuck you.")</i></div><div><br /></div><div>Seeing a bunch of spoiled brats degrade a musical genre and insult the university two of my family members — my educator mother and engineer sister — attended is blood-boiling. You just know it's a matter of when until someone from Queen's will retaliate, even though some might argue the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uM157JH9Q">video response was posted 10 months ahead of time</a>.</div><div><br /></div><div>A little dollar-store cultural anthropology, kids: the great hip-hop came from a place of being an outsider, feeling excluded, be it due to race, class or intellectual sensibility. Those threads run through the rhymes of<b> Ice-T</b>,<b> Chuck D </b>or<b> Eminem</b>. Perhaps that's why the former two struck such a nerve two decades ago with teenaged white boys. It was also evident in the later work of that working-class hero who left us 30 years ago today.</div><div><br /></div><div>Now you have these ciphers, who can quote the lines but have learned none of the meaning, mimicking it to validate their snobby, cliquey superiority. This is what the generation which is going to have to save the world, along with Xers, is wasting its time on? They want to do that, fine, but it's not exactly inspiring.</div><div><br /></div><div>Every generation is entitled to a few years — or decades, in Boomers' case — of  look-at-me preening. So it goes. Hopefully, millennials' gift of sharing its self-involvement so quickly and thoroughly will help them get it out of their systems relatively quickly.</div><span id="fullpost"><div><br /></div><div>Perhaps this is a live-and-let-live deal, it is protected speech, but it is fair to ask what it means. After all, OUA schools have taken a hard line with bad behaviour when it's convenient. In 2009, Guelph suspended senior quarterback <b>Justin Dunk</b> for one game for swearing on live television during a game against Western. How could what Dunk did, off the cuff during a game, be punishable while using the Gryphons logo in a rap that promotes homophobia is okay? Talk about arbitrary rule.</div><div><br /></div><div>I saw this a few weeks ago but withheld comment. My student days are long, long past. There is enough burden involved with getting a degree, especially with runaway student debt<br /><br />However, even as recently as the late 1990s, there was still this notion that post-secondary education was as much about cultivating  some semblance of character and couth, not just the degree. Those qualities count for more in this life than any numbers on a transcript, especially when studies show a lot of those numbers are generated by academic fraud.</div><div><br /></div><div>The bright side is most people have to learn this eventually. Some will make it tougher on themselves than others.</div></span>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"http://neatesager.blogspot.com/2010/12/modern-technology-wont-make-you-ice-t.html";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:6:"author";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:27:"noreply@blogger.com (sager)";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:7:"updated";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"2010-12-08T20:39:26.792-05:00";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:29:"http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/";a:1:{s:9:"thumbnail";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:3:"url";s:116:"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_NNKD3IjazNs/TP-1OsqDx3I/AAAAAAAAA6o/4JrUlmEVM6A/s72-c/whiteandpurple%2B%25281%2529_opt.jpg";s:6:"height";s:2:"72";s:5:"width";s:2:"72";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/syndication/thread/1.0";a:1:{s:5:"total";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"10";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:3:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-16538424.post-7914077166271250824";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 04 Dec 2010 18:42:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"Latest on Brock Lesnar";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2530:"It’s amazing how since his loss against Cain Velasquez at UFC 121, much of the discussion has been about Brock’s next move and not Cain’s.<br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /><span id="fullpost">Since the one round beat down by the hands of Cain, Brock has been rumoured to <br /><br />A)    Wrestle in the WWE<br /><br />B)    Have a 3rd encounter with Frank Mir<br /><br />C)    Fight “Big Country” Roy Nelson, who recently had his bout with Shane Carwin scrapped after the latter pulled out with an injury.<br /><br /><br />Well, UFC boss Dana White has said that Lesnar isn’t going to the WWE, and it doesn’t look like he wants a Lesnar-Nelson fight to happen. Lesnar, and many other fans, don’t seem to be too interested in a third fight with Mir, even though that is the fight that would generate the most dough and PPV buys.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Shane Carwin is still sidelined with a back injury so he’s out as the next opponent for Brock (unless they fight in the spring). Going further down the list of available opponents after Mir and Nelson is Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira who’s definitely a stiff test for Brock and also Ben Rothwell.<br /><br /> <br /><br />If the UFC wants Lesnar to stick around for a while though (and earn some major moolah and PPV buys), they need to develop him and match him perfectly so he can improve. If not, he may have one of the quickest downward spirals in MMA history. <br /><br /> <br /><br />The reality is though, whatever Lesnar’s next move is, and whenever he announces it, many people will be listening closely. He’s still one of the most popular UFC fighters there is, and he can bring in all sorts of fans.<br /><br /> <br /><br />And as far as the question of, “Is Lesnar’s mystique gone?” - or anything along those lines – the answer? Far from it.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Brock has lost twice in the UFC but that’s not that strange for an MMA fighter. No fighter that Brock has fought in the UFC so far has been scared of him.
